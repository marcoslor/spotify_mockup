# Spotify Mockup

A Spotify app mockup written in Flutter

Why did I make this? Ya know, it's the great 20's quarentine time, 
and I have nothing else to do with my life.

I have no idea if I'll get copyrighted from using spotify cnd server w/o permission.
And for using album art and artists names in this repo.
(is that even a thing tho?).
So Mr. Machine that's scrapping the web for copyright strikes, I aim no profit on this.

## How to compile?

Setup Flutter on your machine (visit: https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install for instructions, be sure you have followed all, run `flutter doctor`)

Clone this repo and get dependencies:

```
git clone https//github.com/marcoslor/spotify_mockup
cd spotify_mockup
flutter pub get
```

Preferably, use Intellij IDEA as your IDE. But whatever.

## What to do next?

Well, I want to "inspire" myself from the rest of Spotify's UI and
create the rest of the thing.
Then, use the Spotify's API to make a usable player.

Next would be ditching Spotify API all together and use youtube-dl to
create a music streaming app and downloader (not stonks for Google and recorders).
